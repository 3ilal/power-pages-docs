Power Pages is built on the foundation of Power Apps portals. Many of the tools and methods used to configure Power Pages utilize the functionality of Power Apps portals. 

Power Pages meets the highest levels of trust, transparency, standards conformance, regulatory compliance such as General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) as well as modern TLS crypto standards (TLS 1.2). It conforms with global accessibility standards.
