# Manage sites

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Your Power Pages home serves as the central hub for managing all your sites. Here you can view a list of all sites in your selected environment and take action for each website.

For each website in your environment, the site card provides you details about the site such as:

- Site name and web address

- Site creator's name

- Suggested next steps, as you build and edit your site

- Thumbnail that captures a snapshot of your site. If your website is authenticated, this will show the sign-in page that your users will see.

Each site card also links to actions such as:

- Edit, which redirects you to the [design studio](../getting-started/use-design-studio.md) experience

- Preview, which gives you a glimpse of how your users will view the website

- Share, which lets you copy the link to preview the site
