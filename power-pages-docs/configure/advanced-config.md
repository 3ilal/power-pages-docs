# Advanced configuration

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Power Pages is built on the foundation of Power Apps portals. Many of the tools and methods used to configure Power Pages utilize the functionality of Power Apps portals. 

The following are advanced features of Power Pages that are configured using Power Apps portals.

## Configure Search

In Power Pages, you can search site content and Dataverse records using the global search functionality.

See more: [Configure search](/powerapps/maker/portals/configure/search)

## Power BI

To view dashboards and reports from [Power BI on pages](../getting-started/add-power-bi.md) in a site, you must first enable Power BI visualization from the Power Apps portals admin center.

## Web files

A web file represents downloadable file in a Power Pages site, used to store images, documents, and any other file type.

## SharePoint Integration

You can upload and display documents to and from SharePoint Online directly on a basic form or advanced form in a site.

## Multi-language

A site can display content in multiple languages to reach customers around the world. The content of your Power Pages site can be translated into multiple languages while maintaining a single content hierarchy.
