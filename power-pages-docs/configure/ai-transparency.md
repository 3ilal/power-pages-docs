# AI transparency in Power Pages

We're committed to creating [responsible AI by design](https://www.microsoft.com/ai/responsible-ai). Microsoft has developed a set of responsible AI principles to ensure that its products are developed and used responsibly. Our work is guided by a core set of principles: fairness, reliability and safety, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparency, and accountability. We're putting these principles into practice across the company to develop and deploy AI that will have a positive impact on society. We strive to deploy AI that benefits society and take a comprehensive approach, combining innovative research, exceptional engineering, and responsible governance. Alongside OpenAI’s leading research on AI alignment, we're advancing a framework for the safe deployment of our own AI technologies that's aimed to help guide the industry toward more responsible outcomes.
