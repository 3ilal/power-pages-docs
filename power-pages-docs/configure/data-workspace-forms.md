[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Forms tab displays the forms referenced in the basic forms and all other forms in the environment. It only shows **main** form type that is supported in portals. Clicking on an existing form or creating a new one, launches the **Power Apps form designer** where you can add form fields, components and much more. The form designer only provides features and properties supported by portals. To access all form features, navigate to **Power Apps form designer** from the command bar.
