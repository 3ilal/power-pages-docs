# Create and modify Dataverse views using data workspace

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Views are a subset of table data. Create a view to select specific table columns & rows that you would like to display in a site. The Views tab displays views referenced in the lists and all other views in the environment. It only shows view types that are supported in portals. Clicking on an existing view (or creating a new one) launches the **Power Apps view designer** where you can define the view. Views are a foundation of portals lists.
