# Editing sites created in Power Apps portals

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

There are two experiences for editing Power Pages and Power Apps portals sites.

- The new Power Pages design studio.
- The legacy portals Studio. (Power Apps portals)

From Power Pages home page you can open sites in design studio [created using Power Pages](../getting-started/create-manage.md) and sites [created using Power Apps](/power-apps/maker/portals/create-portal.md). 

In Power Apps, you can will only be able to open sites using created using Power Apps in the portals Studio. Any sites created in Power Pages will open in the design studio.

From Power app portal â€“ maker can only open power app portal site in maker studio. Power pages site will still open in new design studio 

Features missing in power pages studio

Since new power pages design studio is much richer in term of capabilities as compared to powerapps portal studio, if maker customizes their site in design studio and open the site in maker studio, some components might not work seamlessly in maker studio. Some examples are - 

Video component 

Button component 

Spacer component 

Advance styling option for text/image etc 

Multi step forms 

New themes and styling options introduced in new design studio cannot be customized in old studio.
