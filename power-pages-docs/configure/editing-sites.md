# Power Pages design studio and Power Apps portals Studio

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE[powerapps-info](../includes/cc-powerapps-info.md)]

There are two experiences for editing Power Pages and Power Apps portals sites.

- The new [Power Pages design studio](../getting-started/create-manage.md).
- The legacy [Power Apps portals Studio](/power-apps/maker/portals/portal-designer-anatomy). 

From the Power Pages home page, you can open sites in design studio [created using Power Pages](../getting-started/create-manage.md) and sites [created using Power Apps](/power-apps/maker/portals/create-portal.md). 

In Power Apps, you'll only be able to open sites created using Power Apps in the portals Studio. Any sites created in Power Pages will open in the new Power Pages design studio.

## Features not available in the Power Pages design studio

The Power Apps portals Studio has the following features that aren't part of the Power Pages design studio:

- [Web template code editing](/power-apps/maker/portals/work-with-templates)
- [Power Virtual Agent chat bot configuration](/power-apps/maker/portals/add-chatbot) 
- [Breadcrumbs](/power-apps/maker/portals/add-breadcrumb)
- [Custom menus](/power-apps/maker/portals/add-custom-menu)
- [Content snippet editing](/power-apps/maker/portals/customize-component-snippets)

## Components added in design studio

The new Power Pages design studio has new capabilities that aren't available in the Power Apps portal Studio. If you customize a site in the Power Pages design studio and open the site in Power Apps portal Studio, the following components won't be configurable:  

- [Videos](../getting-started/add-video.md) 
- [Buttons](../getting-started/add-button.md)
- [Spacers](../getting-started/add-spacer.md)
- [Text](../getting-started/add-text.md)
- [Images](../getting-started/add-image)
- [Basic forms](../getting-started/add-form)
- [Multistep forms](../getting-started/multistep-forms.md)

New themes and styling options introduced in the [Styling workspace](../getting-started/style-site.md) of the Power Pages design studio can't be customized using the [themes editor](/power-apps/maker/portals/theme-overview) in the Power Apps portals Studio.
