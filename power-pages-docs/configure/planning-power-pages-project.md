# Planning Power Pages project

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]


## Who is this article for

We all have various experiences and expertise in building apps or sites. Each project might have unique needs. Purpose of this article is to bring up a few areas to keep in mind as you embark on a new or maybe revisit a previous project.

## Set clear goals for your project

Building sites is exciting and could be overwhelming especially your first time. Consider coming up with a few simple goals to keep you focused and on track. Allow yourself to be iterative and involve others for feedback; even consider a pilot program with a few close real end-users of your site, they'll provide the best feedback. Ship in smaller iterations but more often, if applicable. 

## Anonymous vs Authenticated 

Your site comes with sample web pages to get you inspired, those pages aren't secured as they contain sample text and images for inspiration only. As you develop content and data experiences, you want to consider if you want those pages secured behind a log in - that would mean Authenticated user context.

## Users Identity

Many sites you and your end-users navigate today have a log in or Register experience where users either create a new log in profile or use an existing log in. That log in part itself could be their personal and social accounts, corporate credentials or custom log in systems - all of these are various identity providers or IdP for short. Power Pages can use many industry standards based Identity Providers. Yon can view the fill list here: <!--link-->

Any authenticated user on your site after they register or log in get a Contact record that represents them. Remember that how (Authentication) your log in to your site doesn't dictate what you do (Authorization). Think of identity as a key or a digital key card. 

### Internal Users

Internal users withing your organization should use Azure AD that should include you, your project team working on this site, and your testers. This is the same login provider as your users use to access Power Platform, Microsoft 365 and likely their Windows machines too. This is great option because in case user is removed from the organization, so is their access to your sites. Great news is that all sites you create with Power Pages start with Azure AD pre-configured. Only remove this option if you don't plan to have your employees use your portal. We suggest you rename the sign in button from Azure AD to something more friendly like "Contoso Employees" or "Contoso Work Account"

### External Users

External users should be using an external identity provider. Let's go over a few options.

### Local Login

Local Login provider is our legacy option and isn't recommend, use it only for quick casual testing early in your project. It's important to know that we're no longer investing in this feature so you wouldn't want to use it in production on a new project. Because this log in provider is local to just this specific site, you can't reuse it across another site, this is frustrating for your end-users. We recommend you Disable Local Login provider especially in Production. See how: Setting up Identity Providers: Setting Default <!--link-->

### Recommendation

Consider Azure AD B2C you might qualify for sizable initial set of users (50,000 monthly logins free at time of writing) <!--link-->

### Why have an external identity provider?
Having a single external identity provider would help you onboard users consistently across multiple future sites, other web sites or web or mobile apps in the future. This way your external users have one login they can use without creating yet another sign in and password. Itâ€™s a good idea to spearhead that as long as you're careful to name and brand your identity provider more generic. Consider something simple like "Contoso Login" or "Contoso Student Login" over hyper specific ones like "Contoso EDU Student Meal Plan Portal Login"  

## Users Security

Any authenticated user on your site after they register or log in get a Contact record that represents them. Remember that how (Authentication) your log into your site doesn't dictate what you do (Authorization). Think of identity as a key or a digital key card. We'll now talk about the what a user gets to do once they're authenticated. 

Remember you are in control of what is shared. Do be aware that there are default settings that make your site easy to demo and experience as you get started that might not be best for all real projects.

## Data Modeling Considerations

Any authenticated user on your site after they register or sign in get a Contact record that represents them. 

There's a native built-in relationship to Accounts table in Dataverse that each Contact record has. You have to intentionally make this association yourself or via automation or data job you design. Again you are in control of this field. If you have another relationship you rather create to a custom table in Dataverse, you're free to do so, you aren't limited.

Knowing this now if we wanted to segment data for users and their organizations, we have the right tools already waiting for us.

Let's say we have orders we want suppliers to review when they sign in, we would want to add a Lookup field for Account table. We want to select a few Accounts on each Order record. We then want to set up just the right Contacts to such Accounts. Then when those contacts sign in to the portal they'll only see the orders intended for them. Even if another supplier sends them a link or savvy users tries to use the Portal Web API they won't be able to touch data not linked to them.

What if you wanted to allow read so anonymous users can see data?

Now that we have started to consider how we'll model any data,

## Portal Project Team Helpful Skills to go Next Level

Everyone brings different skill set to each project. Power Pages make is easy for just about anyone to get started and launch a site. However there are some skills or experience in building sites that would enable your project to accelerate. 

## Consider separate Dev, Test, Production

You want a working area to create and test new features away from live production site. While Power Pages offers ability to install more than one site in each Environment, it's almost always impractical to actually accomplish the needed proper separation working in just one Environment.

### Development Environment 

We encourage you to convert from Trial type to Production type as soon as possible, so you don't lose time resetting up your site host again. Your site is safely kept inside Dataverse

Rename your Website record to best represent your project and tell it apart when moving up.

"Contoso Student Portal" or "Student Site"  but not "Student Dev"

### Testing Environment 

New Environment

Add new Portal

Moving your relevant Dataverse tables in a Solution 

Move your Portal configuration

Update Portal configuration to use your Portal "Student Site" not "Default Template"
	
### Production Environment 

This is the environment your live customers will use

Repeat same as Testing

Here are some other tips from across the Power Platform about good ALM practices.

## User Testing

You want to have a stable test site for your internal stakeholders and any early external testers. This will allow you to have a stable place where users can test while you work on more features and fine tuning in your Development environment. 

You want to list out core outcomes and ensure you have full complete test scenarios documented somewhere for yourself and shared with testers. 

You want your testers to report and take screenshots or recording of what happened. Doing this in a Test Environment would allow you to retest this, then Development address the issue, move the fix to Test Environment to confirm it's addressed before moving the change up to Production.

## Load Testing

If you have high scalability needs (think 1000s of users a month or any critical workload)
