# Portal Management app overview

For managing your Power Pages sites, you'll use the Portal Management app.

> [!NOTE]
> To use the Portal Management app, you will need to be assigned the [system administrator](/power-platform/admin/assign-security-roles) role in the same Microsoft Dataverse environment as your site. Users in the [system customizer](/power-platform/admin/assign-security-roles) role also have access to use the Portal Management app however they may have limited privileges on certain tables (e.g. Notes / Attachments related to [Web Files](/power-apps/maker/portals/configure/web-files)) that do not allow them to view or update records created by other users. 

## Open the Portal Management app

In the design studio, select the ellipsis (**...**) from the tool belt, and then select **Portal Management**.
