# Using solutions with Power Pages

Using solutions with Power Pages allows to contain and transport all website configuration using standard Power Platform solutions.

## Prerequisites

To try this feature, you'll require two Power Platform environments that have the enhanced data model enabled, one designated as the source and the other as the target. See [Power Pages enhanced data model](../getting-started/enhanced-data-model.md) to enable the enhanced data model for an environment.

Each environment will required a site that is created using the new data model. See [create a website with an enhanced data model](../getting-started/enhanced-data-model.md#create-a-website-with-an-enhanced-data-model).

## Add Power Pages site and its component to a solution

1. From the Power Pages home page, select the **Solutions** tab.
