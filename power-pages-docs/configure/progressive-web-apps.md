# Overview of sites as progressive web apps

You can enable your site as a progressive web app (PWA), with native app–like look and feel, by using the [Set up workspace](setup-workspace.md) in the Power Pages design studio.

We're applying progressive web app technology to convert a site to a multi-platform supported app, which works on all platforms (Android/iOS/Windows/Chrome) and all form factors (mobile/desktop/tablet). It even works on specialized platforms like chrome books.

PWAs are built for cross-platform interoperability through browser support that provides users a native app–like experience. PWAs bring a seamless experience for users across different web browsers. These apps can be installed from the browser or through app stores. This capability enables external and internal customers to use a portal as an app. They can also pin the app directly to the home screen on their mobile device.

PWAs can be used for both online and offline scenarios. As a maker, you can choose to enable specific pages in your site to be available offline (the content on these pages is read-only).

PWAs can be distributed to end users through app stores or a browser based download and install. For additional details, see [Build and distribute progressive web apps](build-progressive-web-apps.md).
