# Overview of sites as progressive web apps

You can enable your site as a progressive web app (PWA), with native app–like look and feel, by using the [Set up workspace](setup-workspace.md) in the Power Pages design studio.

We're applying progressive web app technology to convert a site to a multi-platform supported app, which works on all platforms (Android/iOS/Windows/Chrome) and all form factors (mobile/desktop/tablet). It will even work on specialized platforms like chrome books.

PWAs are built for cross-platform interoperability through browser support that provides users a native app–like experience. PWAs bring a seamless experience for users across different web browsers. These apps can be installed from the browser or through app stores. This capability enables external and internal customers to use a portal as an app. They can also pin the app directly to the home screen on their mobile device.

PWAs can be used for both online and offline scenarios. As a maker, you can choose to enable specific pages in your site to be available offline (the content on these pages will be read-only).

The following graphics illustrate the users' experience of adding a portal to their home screen by using the browser that installs the portal as a PWA.

The next image the user is prompted to install the app, and the last image shows the app with its custom background and branding, operating as a native mobile app." border="false":::

Makers can also install the site PWA from their device's app store, if you created an app package and published the app to the app store for their device.

> [!Note]
> Publishing your PWA to the iOS app store is currently not supported.
