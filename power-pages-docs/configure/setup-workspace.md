## Authentication

You can configure various authentication providers to allow access to protected pages and data. For more information, go to [Configure Power Pages authentication](../security/configure-portal-authentication.md).

## Table permissions

You can configure table permissions on Dataverse tables used in your Power Pages site. For more information, go to [Configure table permissions](../security/table-permissions.md).

## Mobile

You'll have the ability to learn more about progressive web apps (PWAs) using Power Pages.<!--note from editor: Not sure what "You'll have the ability" means. Could it be "In this section, you'll learn more about..."? Also, "using" is ambiguous here. Should it be "by using Power Pages" or "built by using Power Pages," or "that use Power Pages"? -->

## Administration

The Administration section is where you can access the Power Pages admin center.
