# What is the difference between Power Pages and Power Apps portals

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Power Pages is built on the foundation of [Power Apps portals](/power-apps/maker/portals/) and utilizes the same platform capabilities, infrastructure, features and tools.

Along with the extensible data model and pro-developer customization experiences of Power Apps portals, Power Pages adds new low code experiences and out-of-the-box solution templates.

The following new features currently in preview to allow customers to try with their existing and new Power Apps portals projects:

- [New design studio with productivity workspaces](getting-started/use-design-studio.md)
- [Improved trial and site creation experience](getting-started/trial-signup.md)
- [Templates hub](templates/index.md)
- [Learn hub](getting-started/use-learnhub.md)

Power Apps portals will continue to be the platform to build enterprise-grade external business applications.

When Power Pages becomes generally available, all your current configuration and development efforts with Power Apps portals will be automatically fully compatible with Power Pages.
