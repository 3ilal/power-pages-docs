# What is the difference between Power Pages and Power Apps portals

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Power Pages is an enterprise-grade low-code SaaS platform for creating, hosting, and administering rich external business web applications to allow organizations to better serve their customers, partners, and citizen audiences.

Power Pages is built on the foundation of [Power Apps portals](/power-apps/maker/portals/) and utilizes the same infrastructure, metadata and tools.

Power Pages provides the following new features currently in preview to allow customers to try with their existing and new Power Apps portals projects:

- [New Design studio with productivity workspaces](/getting-started/use-design-studio.md)
- [Improved trial and site creation experience](/getting-started/trial-signup.md)
- [Templates hub](/templates/index.md)
- [Learn hub](/getting-started/use-learnhub.md)

Power Apps portals will continue to be the platform to build enterprise-grade external business applications and all your current configuration and development efforts will be fully compatible with Power Pages when the new features become GA.
