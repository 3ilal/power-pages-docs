# FAQ for AI-generated site

These frequently asked questions (FAQ) describe the AI impact of Ai-generated site feature in Power Pages.

## What is Copilot to generate site?

You can use Copilot in Power Pages to describe the site you're trying to build from the Power Pages home. Once you've entered your description, Power Pages will use generative AI to determine the sitemap and generate homepage layout variations and addional pages. Once the site is created, you can continue to use Copilot inside the design studio to modify and refine the site.

## What are capabilities of Copilot to generate site?

The system allows you to generate a site by describing the site you're looking to create, in natural language. This feature reduces the time it takes for you to build a site. This capability significantly simplifies the decision making process and accelerates site creation as you don't need to spend time to build each page. The system generates the relevant site name, site address, home page layout and additional pages, where you can choose these suggestions or make changes needed and create a site. 

## What is the intended use of Copilot to generate site?

The goal of Copilot to generate a site is to provide you with assistance in creating a site in Power Pages. To ensure new or less experienced developers can easily create relevant sites better and faster to build a site of quality and in less time.

## How was Copilot to generate site evaluated? What metrics are used to measure performance?

Copilot to generate site underwent substantial testing before the feature was released. It relies on user feedback to report if the AI-generated site name, address, home page and other pages are not relevant or inappropriate. If you encounter irrelevant or inappropriate responses, report it to Microsoft using the thumbs down gesture and include feedback in the form. We track the telemetry of thumbs up and thumbs down gestures present in the Copilot experiences for each AI-generated output. Your feedback helps improve the functionality moving forward. In addition to this, we also track this feature's SLA to make sure it's always available to you.
