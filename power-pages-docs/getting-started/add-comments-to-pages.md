# Add comments to pages in design studio

You can collaborate and communicate while building Power Pages sites in design studio by using comments. Comments can help your team review the changes, provide feedback, and provide additional information on site customization. 

> [!NOTE]
> Makers must have permission to edit the site before they can add comments.

In the design studio, anchors depict comments added to a Page and let you add new comments as well.

## Add a comment to a page

Add your comments directly to a page in the design studio from the Pages workspace.

1. Open the design studio and select the page you'd like from the pages pane.

1. Select Comments on the command bar. This opens the comments pane for the selected Page. You can also open the comments pane by selecting the comment icon to view existing comments for a page.

## Edit or delete a comment

Edit your comments or remove existing comments in design studio from the Comments pane.

1. Select **...** next to the comment.
1. Choose **Edit comment** or **Delete comment**.

## Resolve a comment

Resolve or reopen a comment thread to better track the active comments from the Comments pane.

1. Select **...** next to the comment.
1. Choose **Resolve comment**. 

The comment thread appears as **Resolved**. To reopen select **Reopen thread**. To delete the comment thread, select **Delete thread**.

## Tag someone in the comments

Tag makers in the comments by using @ followed by their name.

If you tag a maker that doesn't have access to your app, you'll be prompted to grant the maker site edit permission.

When someone tags you in a comment, you'll receive an email. The email includes  the name of the person who tagged you, which page you're tagged in, the comment text, and a direct link to the comment.

## Moving comments between environments

Comments in Power Page sites can't be exported or imported as solution components because they contain user collaboration data; however, you can export the Comment table to Excel and then import the Excel file into your environment.
