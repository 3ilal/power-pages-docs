If you want to select a previously uploaded image, choose an image from the Select image list. To upload a new image, select Upload image. All the uploaded images are included in the image library, which can be selected again through the Select image list. |
    | External URL | Select this option if you would like to upload an image from an external URL. Enter the URL in the External URL field.
