    | Option | Description |
    | ----------- | ----------- |

To upload a new image, select **Upload image**. All the uploaded images are included in the image library, which you can select again through the **Select image** list. |
    | External URL | Select this option if you want to upload an image from an external URL. Enter the URL in the **External URL** field. Only secured links are acceptedâ€”that is, **https://** is mandatory. If you have images stored in your content delivery network, you can provide the link in this field. |

1. To format your image, select it and a menu with editing options will appear:

    - Select a new image

    - Configure the alignment

    - Add alt text

    - Duplicate the image, move it up, move it down, or delete it

1. You can also adjust the size of the image by selecting it and adjusting the height and width.
