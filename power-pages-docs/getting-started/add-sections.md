## Editing a section

Once a Section is added, clicking the Section will open the properties bar:  

| Property | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Background | Enables the user to change the color of the background according to the color palette for the selected styling template. |
| Layout | Allows  the user to change the layout of the section after it has been added to the page.  Users can manually adjust the width and height of the columns.
