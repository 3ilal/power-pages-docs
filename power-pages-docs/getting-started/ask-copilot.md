## Prerequisites

To use this feature in Power Pages

- Your environment must be located in the United States.
- Your browser language must be set to US-English.
- When prompted by Copilot, select the `Ask` mode in the sidecar.

## Prompt Copilot 

You can choose from the starter prompts displayed in the sidecar, or write your own prompts directly in the text input field.

>[!NOTE]
> You must [enable  Bing search](#enable-bing-search) before Copilot answers your question.

If you select a starter prompt, it appears in the text input field. You can modify these prompts before submitting them.

## Enable Bing search

When you enter a question in the Copilot sidecar, you're prompted to enable Bing search if it isn't enabled already:

`Some of the questions you ask may require Copilot to use Bing to search resources that are outside of your organization.  Is that okay?`
Choose from the available options:<br />
`- Yes, but just for this question`<br />
`- Yes, until I close this chat`<br />
`- No, not now`

You can also select the gear icon next to Bing search in the Copilot sidecar and switch the toggle next for Bing search to the on position. `Bing search is enabled` appears next to the icon.
