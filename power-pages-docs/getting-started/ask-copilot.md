# Ask Copilot questions

An easy way to get support while building your Power Pages website is to ask Copilot for help. You can get started by asking Copilot for help questions that you usually search for in the documentation. Example questions you could ask would include:

* How do I add more colors to my style themes?
* How do I bring my own data to my site?
* What are custom solutions?

Remember that you can only ask questions about building your website in Power Pages. If you're unable to get a response, try to ask again by rephrasing your question using smaller sentences. If you're still unsuccessful, you can always find help in the [Microsoft Power Pages documentation](../index.yml) .

## Prerequisites

To use this feature in Power Pages

* You must [enable Bing search](#enable-bing-search) to get answers to your questions using Copilot.

## Prompt Copilot

Ask Copilot questions and get responses while working inside the Pages workspace in Power Pages design studio.

1. Go to the [Pages workspace](first-page.md).
1. Within the Copilot sidecar, select **Ask**.

    If the Ask option does not appear, your administrator may need to [allow Bing search](/power-platform/admin/geographical-availability-copilot#turn-on-copilots-and-generative-ai-features-1).

1. Choose from the starter prompts displayed in the sidecar, or write your own prompts directly in the text input field.

    If you select a starter prompt, it appears in the text input field. You can modify these prompts before submitting them.

1. Press the Enter key or select the paper airplane icon in the lower-right corner of the text box to send Copilot your question.

Copilot generates an answer to your question. Depending on the question, the results might include step-by-step instructions.

## Enable Bing search

When you enter a question in the Copilot sidecar, you're prompted to enable Bing search if it isn't enabled already. You can also select the gear icon next to Bing search in the Copilot sidecar and switch the toggle for Bing search to the on position. Once enabled, `Bing search is enabled` appears next to the icon.
