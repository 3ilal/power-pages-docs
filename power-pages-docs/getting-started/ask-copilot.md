## Prerequisites

To use this feature in Power Pages

- Your environment must be located in the United States.
- Your browser language must be set to US-English.
- When prompted by Copilot, select the `Ask` mode in the sidecar.

## Prompt Copilot 

You can choose from the starter prompts displayed in the sidecar, or write your own prompts directly in the text input field.

When you select a starter prompt, it appears in the text input field. You can modify these prompts before submitting them.

>[!NOTE]
> You must [enable  Bing search](#enabling-bing-search) before Copilot answers your question.

When you enter a question in the Copilot sidecar, you are prompted to enable Bing search if it isn't enabled already:

`Some of the questions you ask may require Copilot to use Bing to search resources that are outside of your organization.  Is that okay?`

Choose from the available options:<br />
`- Yes, but just for this question`<br />
`- Yes, until I close this chat`<br />
`- No, not now`

## Enabling Bing search

Select the gear icon next to Bing search in the Copilot sidecar and switching the toggle next for Bing search to the on position to enable Bing search. `Bing search is enabled` appears next to the icon.
