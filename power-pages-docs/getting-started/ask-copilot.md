## Prerequisites

To use this feature in Power Pages

- Your environment must be located in the United States.
- Your browser language must be set to US-English.
- When prompted by Copilot, select the `Ask` mode in the sidecar.
- You must [enable Bing search](#enable-bing-search) to get answers to your questions using Copilot.

## Prompt Copilot 

Ask Copilot questions and get responses while working inside the Pages workspace in Power Pages design studio.

1. Go to the [Pages workspace](first-page.md).
1. Choose from the starter prompts displayed in the sidecar, or write your own prompts directly in the text input field.

    If you select a starter prompt, it appears in the text input field. You can modify these prompts before submitting them.

1. Press the Enter key or select the paper airplane icon in the lower-right corner of the text box to send Copilot your question.

Copilot generates an answer to your question. Depending on the question, the results might include step-by-step instructions.

## Enable Bing search

When you enter a question in the Copilot sidecar, you're prompted to [enable Bing search](/power-platform/admin/geographical-availability-copilot#turn-on-copilots-and-generative-ai-features-1) if it isn't enabled already:

`Some of the questions you ask may require Copilot to use Bing to search resources that are outside of your organization.  Is that okay?` <br />
Choose from the available options: <br />
`- Yes, but just for this question` <br />
`- Yes, until I close this chat` <br />
`- No, not now`

You can also select the gear icon next to Bing search in the Copilot sidecar and switch the toggle for Bing search to the on position. Once enabled, `Bing search is enabled` appears next to the icon.
