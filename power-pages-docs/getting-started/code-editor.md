# Customize webpages by using the code editor

## Using the code editor

To view the source code of the page on the canvas, select the code editor icon &lt;/&gt; in the command bar.

The source code is displayed in the code editor pane at the bottom of the screen. Any changes you made previously will be updated in the source code. To make changes, update the source code and then select **Save**. The changes will be reflected on the canvas.

The code editor supports three docking options: docked on the bottom, docked on the right side, or full-screen edit mode.

The code editor canvas supports HTML editing. To edit JavaScript or custom CSS, select **Edit CSS & JS**, which will take you to the Portal Management app. From there, select the **Advanced** tab to make any edits you want in the JavaScript and CSS sections.
