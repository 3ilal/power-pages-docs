[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## Using the code editor

To view the source code of the page on the canvas, select the code editor icon &lt;/&gt; in the command bar.

The source code is displayed in the Code Editor pane at the bottom of the screen. The changes you made earlier are updated in the source code. To make changes, update the source code and select Save. The changes are reflected on the canvas.

The code editor supports 3 docking options: docked on bottom, docked on right, or full screen edit mode.

Canvas supports editing of html. To edit JavaScript or custom CSS, click on 'Edit CSS & JS.' This will take you to portal management app. From there, choose the **Advanced** tab you can make any desired edits in the JavaScript and CSS sections.
