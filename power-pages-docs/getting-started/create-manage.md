# Create a site with Power Pages

Power Pages provides a list of templates to choose from to quickly build your site. Customize and design your site using the new Power Pages design studio. Choose a default template to build your site or use scenario-based templates to accelerate creating your site.

> [!TIP]
> We've created a series of tutorials and videos for you to learn to use Power Pages, where you start with a simple site and progressively add components and features as your business requires. For more information, go to [Power Pages tutorials](tutorial-overview.md).

1. Go to [Power Pages](https://make.powerpages.microsoft.com/).

    The first time you visit the site, you'll be presented with a **Try it for free** button and be able to [sign up for a free, 30-day trial](trial-signup.md).

1. Select the [Microsoft Dataverse environment](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview) in which to create a site.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It is not recommended to create a site in the [*default* environment](/power-platform/admin/environments-overview#the-default-environment) as it is shared across all the users in the tenant, and has a risk of sharing data with unintentional users.

1. On the home page, select **+ Create a site**.

1. Review the available templates. For more details about each template, you can also hover over the template, and choose **Preview template**. And then, follow different views across devices to preview the template experience.

    > [!TIP]
    > Prefer a template that best aligns to what you want to use your site for. If none of the business need templates match what you're looking for, choose one of the **Site design** templates with cross-industry solutions, or choose **Blank page** to customize the website from scratch. More information: [Power Pages templates](../templates/index.md)

1. After you finalize the template of your choice, select **Choose this template**.

1. Validate the default site name and web address that have been created, and then select **Done**.

    > [!NOTE]
    > It might take a few moments for your new site to be provisioned. You'll be able to modify the name and web address later.

1. After the site is created, you can begin to edit or preview your site.

## Additional info

To speed up the process when you create a site with a new trial environment, the site metadata for all the [templates](../templates/index.md) will be preloaded and appear as website records in the [Portal Management app](../configure/portal-management-app.md).
