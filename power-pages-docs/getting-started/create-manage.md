# Create your first site with Power Pages

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Power Pages provides you with a list of templates to choose from to quickly build your site and then customize and design it in accordance with your requirements, by using the new Power Pages design studio. You can choose a default template to build your site or choose scenario-based templates to accelerate creating your site.

> [!TIP]
> We've created a series of tutorials and videos for you to learn to use Power Pages, where you start with a simple site and progressively add components and features as your business requires. For more information, go to [Power Pages tutorials](tutorial-overview.md).
<!--note from editor: In lines 31, 35, and 39, is "maker studio" correct or should these references be "design studio"?-->
1. Go to [Power Pages](https://make.powerpages.microsoft.com/).

    The first time you visit the site, you'll be presented with a **Get started** button and be able to [sign up for a free, 30-day trial](trial-signup.md). 

1. On the home page, select **Create a site**.

1. After the site is created, you can begin to edit or preview your site.
