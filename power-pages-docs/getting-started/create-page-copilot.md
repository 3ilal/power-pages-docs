# Create an AI-generated webpage using Copilot

You can create a new webpage for your site by describing the type of webpage. Copilot generates the HTML for the page with relevant text copy and images from the description. The page is added to the main navigation of the site, and can be refined and edited using Copilot and the WYSIWYG editor.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - To understand the capabilities and limitations of this feature, see [FAQ for Copilot for design studio](../faqs-design-studio.md).

## Generate a webpage

To use Copilot to generate a webpage:

1. Go to [Power Pages](https://make.powerpages.microsoft.com/).

1. Go to the **Pages** workspace.

1. Select the **Copilot** button in the command bar.

    - Type a description of your webpage in the **Choose a starter prompt, request an action, or ask a question** text field.
    
        Sample descriptions:

        - Create a FAQ webpage for student loans.

        - Create a product page for student loan options.

After the page is generated, it's added to the main navigation, and you can review the page and the content. Sections, text, and images in the page are low-code editable using the WYSIWYG editor.

## Discard a Copilot-generated webpage

If you don't want to keep the page that Copilot generated, you can:

- Undo the changes. This action reverts the Copilot changes and deletes the page. 
    
    >[!NOTE] 
    > 
    > Copilot-generated pages will reference images that are saved as [web files](../configure/web-files.md).

## Edit a page with Copilot

Additionally, you can edit a page with Copilot by typing the following commands in the Copilot input field box:

|Command  |Description  |
|---------|---------|
|Add a section    | Copilot creates a new section with text copy and images, and appends the section to the end of the page.         |
|Add a form     | To learn how to add a form using Copilot, see [Create AI-generated form using Copilot](add-form-copilot.md)         |
