# Customize webpages

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## Design studio page editor

After adding the webpages you need and managing their hierarchy in the site map, you can add various components. The WYSIWYG design studio page editor is part of the Pages workspace. Use the editor to add and edit the components you need within the canvas.

### Using the editor

To use the editor:

1. Open the [design studio](use-design-studio.md) to edit the content and components of the portal.

1. Go to the **Pages** workspace.

1. Select the page where you'd like to add the component or section.

1. To add a section, hover over any editable section area, and then select the plus sign (**+**). You can then choose between six section layout options.

1. To add a component, hover over the section where you'd like to place the component, and then select **+**. You can then choose between the available components.

1. To delete a component, choose the component on the canvas and then select **Delete**.

For a more immersive editing experience, you can use the full-screen editing mode by selecting the double arrow icon in the upper-left corner of the editor. You can also switch to the [code editor](code-editor.md), **zoom in (+)**,  **zoom out (-)**, or **Reset** the page design canvas view back to 100%.

All sections and components allow for in-context editing. You can edit any section or component directly from the canvas.

> [!NOTE]
> - You cannot delete the header or footer in the Pages workspace. See [Web templates](../configure/store-content-web-templates.md) for information on creating custom page layouts.
