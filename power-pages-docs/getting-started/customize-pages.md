# Customize web pages

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## Design studio page editor

After adding the required webpages and managing their hierarchy in the sitemap, you can add various components. The WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor is part of the Pages workspace.

The editor allows you to add and edit the required components within the canvas.

### Using the editor

To use the editor:

1. Open the [Power Apps portals studio](/getting-started/use-design-studio.md) to edit the content and components of the portal.

1. Navigate to the **Pages** workspace.

1. Select the page where you'd like to add the component or section.

1. To add a section, hover to any editable section area and choose the + icon. You can then select between six section layout options.

1. To add a component, hover on the intended section where you would like the component to be and select the + icon. You can then choose between the available components.

1. To delete a component, choose the component on the canvas and then select delete.

For a more immersive editing experience, maker can utilize full screen editing mode by clicking the double arrow icon on the top right-hand corner of the WYSISYG editor.

All sections and components allow for in-context editing.  This allows you to edit any section or component directly from the canvas.
