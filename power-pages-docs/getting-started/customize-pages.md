# Customize web pages

## WYSIWYG editor

After adding the required webpages and managing their hierarchy in the sitemap, you can add various components. The WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor is part of the Pages workspace.

The WYSIWYG editor allows you to add and edit the required components within the canvas.

### Using the WYSIWYG editor

To use the WYSIWYG editor:

1. Open the [Power Apps portals studio](docs.microsoft.com/powerapps/maker/portals/portal-designer-anatomy) to edit the content and components of the portal.

1. Ensure that the toggle for New Design Studio is on before you navigate to the Pages Workspace.

1. Select the page where you'd like to add the component or section.

1. To add a section, hover to any editable section area and choose the + icon. You can then select between the following 6 section layout options.

1. To add a component, hover on the intended section where you would like the component to be and select the + icon. You can then choose between the available components.  

1. To delete a component, choose the component on the canvas and then select delete.

For a more immersive editing experience, maker can utilize full screen editing mode by clicking the double arrow icon on the top right-hand corner of the WYSISYG editor.

All sections and components allow for in-context editing.  This allows you to edit any section or component directly from the canvas.

## Using the code editor

To view the source code of the page on the canvas, select the code editor icon &lt;/&gt; in the commanding bar or choose 'edit page code' from page menu.

The source code is displayed in the Code Editor pane at the bottom of the screen. The changes you made earlier are updated in the source code. To make changes, update the source code and select Save. The changes are reflected on the canvas.

The code editor supports 3 docking options: docked on bottom, docked on right, or full screen edit mode.

Canvas supports editing of html. To edit JavaScript or custom CSS, click on 'Edit CSS & JS.' This will take you to portal management app.  From there, you can make any desired edits.
