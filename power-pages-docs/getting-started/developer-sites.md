# Use developer sites in Power Pages

Power Pages developer websites empower you to develop, test, and upskill your capabilities without signing up for time-bound trials. 

## Advantages of developer sites

Power Pages developer websites offer all the same features as standard Power Pages websites; however, Power Pages developer websites don't expire in 30 days and may be kept for as long as they have active usage. More information: [Create a site with Power Pages](getting-started/create-manage.md) 

## Restrictions for developer sites

Power Pages developer websites aren't optimized for production sites and have the following restrictions:

- Developer sites are private by default and can't be made public. More information: [Site visibility in Power Pages](security/site-visibility.md)
- Developer websites can't be converted to production websites. More information: [Power Pages lifecycle](admin/lifecycle.md)
- Each user is allowed to create three developer websites. Once you've created your developer site, you can migrate it to a test or production site. More information: [Overview of Power Pages ALM](configure/portals-alm.md)
