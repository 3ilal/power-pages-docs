# Use developer sites in Power Pages

Power Pages developer websites empower you to develop, test, and upskill your capabilities without signing up for time-bound trials. 

## Advantages of developer sites

Power Pages developer websites offer all the same features as standard Power Pages websites; however, Power Pages developer websites don't expire in 30 days and may be kept for as long as they have active usage. More information: [Create a site with Power Pages](create-manage.md)

## Restrictions for developer sites

Power Pages developer websites aren't optimized for production sites and have the following restrictions:

- Developer sites are private by default and can't be made public. More information: [Site visibility in Power Pages](../security/site-visibility.md)
- Developer websites can't be [converted](../admin/convert-site.md) to production websites, however, you can [migrate](../admin/migrate-site-configuration.md) a developer website to a production website on a production or sandbox environment. More information: [Power Pages lifecycle](../admin/lifecycle.md).
- Each user is allowed to create three developer websites. Once you've created your developer site, you can migrate it to a test or production site.
