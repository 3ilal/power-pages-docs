# Enable chatbot in a Power Pages site (preview)

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A chatbot with AI can provide quick and efficient customer support to end users. It can answer their queries and provide solutions to their problems in a conversational manner, which can improve overall user experience. Now you can enable [Power Virtual Agents](/power-virtual-agents/nlu-boost-conversations) with a boost conversation powered chat bot on your site to assist end-users with quicker resolution of their queries.

## Prerequisites

- Chatbot feature is available only for the site created in US region.
- You can enable this feature for the site created in English base language.
- To enable the chatbot, the site should be public. More information: [Site visibility in Power Pages](../security/site-visibility.md)
- Tenant Administrator can turn off the chatbot feature on Power Pages site by preventing [publishing of the bot](/power-virtual-agents/nlu-boost-conversations#publishing)
- Adding or changing the custom domain for a Power Pages site after the chatbot has been created isn't supported. Instead, disable the chatbot and enable it after making the custom domain changes.

    > [!NOTE]
    > When you create a chatbot on the Power Pages site, a bot with boosted conversation is created in Power Virtual Agents.

    When you enable the chatbot on site, the site URL is passed to Bing for indexing. This process may take several hours to a day. To trigger Bing to index your site's content immediately, you can use Bing Webmaster. Learn more: [Force Bing webmaster to index your site](force-bing-index.md)

1. Test the chatbot by opening it Power Virtual Agents studio.

1. Publish the chatbot on Power Pages site.

## Publishing Chatbot

Publishing the chatbot on site is governed at **Power Platform Admin Center**. If you'd like to publish a bot, you need to ask your admin to enable it for your tenant in theÂ **Power Platform admin center**. More information: [Publish chatbot with boosted conversations](/power-virtual-agents/nlu-boost-conversations#publishing)

## Advanced customization

The chatbot component is rendered using a web template called Power Virtual Agents.
