# Create and design pages

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A page in Power Pages is a webpage, a document that is identified by a unique URL in a website. 

A page is one of the core objects of the website and builds a hierarchy of the website through parent and child relationships to other pages.

## Create a page

1. Open the [design studio](use-design-studio.md) to edit the content and components of your Power Pages site.

1. From the left command bar, select Pages and choose any of the **"+"** signs.

    - Selecting the **Add a page** icon in the **Main navigation** section will add a new page, which will also add a menu item to default navigation of the site.

    - Selecting the **Add a page** icon on the **Other pages** section will add a new page but won't add a link to the default navigation of the site.

1. Choose a page from Standard layouts, or create a Custom layout.
