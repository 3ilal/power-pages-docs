# Create and design pages

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

A page in Power Pages is a webpage, a container for content that's identified by a unique URL in a website. A page is one of the core objects of the website. The parent and child relationships among pages build the hierarchy of a website.

## Create a page

The **Pages** workspace enables you to design and build webpages with in-context editing and add content with no-code and low-code widgets such as text, image, video, Power BI reports, lists, forms, and others.

1. Open the [design studio](use-design-studio.md) to edit the content and components of your Power Pages site.

1. On the left pane, select **Pages**, and then select one of the plus signs (**+**).

    - Selecting the **Add a page** icon in the **Main navigation** section adds a new page, which will also add a menu item to the default navigation of the site.

    - Selecting the **Add a page** icon in the **Other pages** section adds a new page, but won't add a link to the default navigation of the site.

1. Choose a page from standard layouts, or choose a custom layout.

    For detailed information on how to create custom page templates, go to [Create and manage page templates](/power-apps/maker/portals/configure/page-templates) and [Store source content by using web templates](/power-apps/maker/portals/liquid/store-content-web-templates) in the Power Apps documentation.

1. Add content and components to your page. For more information, go to [Customize pages](customize-pages.md).

## Preview a page

You can preview your site by selecting **Preview** from the command bar. Select **Desktop** to preview your page in a browser, or scan the QR code to view the page on a mobile device.
