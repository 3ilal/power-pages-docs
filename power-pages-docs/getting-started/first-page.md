# Create your first Power Pages site

## Create and Design Pages 

A page in Power Pages is a webpage, a document that is identified by a unique URL in a website. It is one of the core objects of the website and builds a hierarchy of the website through parent and child relationships to other webpages.

### Create a Page

1. Open the [Power Apps Portals Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/portal-designer-anatomy) to edit the content and components of the portal.

1. Ensure that the toggle for New Design Studio is on and then navigate to the pages workspace.

    - Clicking the components icon in the Main Navigation section will add a new page which will come up on the header of home page.

    - Clicking the components icon on the Other Pages will add a new page outside of the header

1. Choose a page from Standard layouts, or create a Custom layout.

    - Move to Main Navigation: Show the page in the Header of Home page.

    - Move up: Move the page up in hierarchy.

    - Move down: Move the page down in hierarchy.

    - Add a new subpage: Add a child page to the selected page. The child page inherits the page template of its parent page.

    - Promote this subpage: Decrease the indent and make the child page at the level of the previous page in the hierarchy.

    - Make this a subpage: Increase the indent and make the page a child page of the previous page in the hierarchy.

    - Delete: Delete the page.
