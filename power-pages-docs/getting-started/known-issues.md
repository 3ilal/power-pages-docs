# Known Issues

## Pages workspace

- Buttons added in portals built with CDS starter template can't be resized.

- You cannot add deleted header logo/text in the new maker studio.  If you neded to delete these items, you'll need to do so in Portal 1.0.  Use the toggle in the command bar to return to Portal 1.0 and use code editor to add text/logo.

- Code editor doesn't support editing of header or footer code.

## Styling workspace

- Doesn't support Google Fonts due to privacy concerns.

- Section padding/margin settings feature in styling workspace will not work for portals built on CDS starter templates.
