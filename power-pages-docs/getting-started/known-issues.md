# Known Issues 

## Pages workspace

    - Buttons added in Portals built with CDS Starter template can't be resized.

    - If header- logo/text is deleted there is no way to add it back in Portals 2.0 studio. You'll have to go back in Portal 1.0 using toggle in commanding bar and use code editor to add text/logo.

    - Code editor doesn't support editing of header or footer code

## Styling workspace

    - Doesn't support Google Fonts due to privacy concerns.

    - Section padding/margin settings feature in styling workspace will not work for portals built on CDS Starter templates.

## Portals 1.0

    - Button component created in new studio cant be labeled in old studio.
