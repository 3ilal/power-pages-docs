# Migrate existing site from Bootstrap version 3 to Bootstrap version 5

You can migrate your existing websites running on Bootstrap v3 to version 5 using the PAC CLI based migration tool provided by Power Pages. 

Sites created with Bootstrap version 5 have functional parity with Bootstrap version 3; however, you may notice some minor changes between the two. Changes include UX improvements like spacing, icons, edges of components like buttons, text etc.

**Pre-requisite**

1.  You need PAC CLI to use the Bootstrap upgrade tool to migrate your version 3 sites to Bootstrap version 5

2.  We suggest for migration of your existing website, create a dev environment to run the migration tool and test the changes with respect to the production website.

3.  You can migrate power pages site based out of **any** template.


### **Installation Instructions**

1.  Install the Power Platform Tools for Visual Studio Code: [Microsoft Power Platform CLI - Power Platform \| Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/cli/introduction#install-using-power-platform-tools-for-visual-studio-code)

2.  You must **enable FCB** in PAC CLI to use the command required to migrate sites from version 3 to version 5. Before beginning this step, ensure that the PAC version is 1.23.3 or higher.

    1.  If PAC is installed using the VS Code extension -

        1.  Steps -

            1.  open the file: C:\\Users\\&lt;User&gt;\\AppData\\Roaming\\Code\\User\\globalStorage\\microsoft-isvexptools.powerplatform-vscode\\pac\\tools\\featureflags.json and

            2.  change the value of the flag **verbPAPortalBootstrapMigrate** from 'off' to 'on'

    2.  If PAC tool is installed using [PAC CLI](https://aka.ms/PowerAppsCLI),

        1.  Steps

            1.  open the file &lt;install-directory&gt;\\tools\\featureflags.json and

            2.  change the value of the flag **verbPAPortalBootstrapMigrate** from 'off' to 'on'

3.  Authenticate to the Dataverse Org from where the website record will be downloaded for migration.

    1.  Open the command prompt.

    2.  Command: pac auth create --url https://dataverseOrg.crm10.dynamics.com

    3.  PAC CLI Auth ref: [Pac Auth](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/auth)

### **Running the migration tool**

1.  If your site user SVG file anywhere. Make sure you enabled .svg file support for your site in your environment. Steps -

    1.  Choose Gear icon in top bar and then choose **advanced** settings

    2.  Select on dropdown next to settings and choose **Customizations**

### **Step 1: Creating two sites in Bootstrap version 3**

1.  We **suggest** to create two sites with Bootstrap version 3 in your environment. Use one of these sites in the migration process. The second site created is only for a reference to compare with the migrated site. Migration can be performed with just one site.

**Note** â€“ This isn't a prerequisite but a suggestion from our end.

### **Step 2: Downloading the website folder**

1.  List the websites in the current organization using the command:  
 **pac paportal list**

2.  Download the website folder using PAC CLI download command( [PAC CLI Doc](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/developer/cli/reference/paportal#pac-paportal-download) ).

    1.  Command Prompt: pac paportal download -p "DownloadDestinationPath" -id "WebsiteID"

    2.  Where **-p refers to the folder path and -id refers to the website id**

### **Step 3: Running the migration tool on the website folder**

1.  Use the bootstrap-migrate command to run the tool on the downloaded website folder.

    1.  Command: pac paportal bootstrap-migrate -p "WebsiteFolderPath"

2.  A new folder is created after running the migration with "**version 5**" appended to the name of the folder.

### **Step 4: Reviewing the diffs using the custom VS code extension: BootstrapMigrationDiff**

1.  Open the version 5 folder that was created after the migration process in VS Code

2.  Open an html/css file to compare the difference.

    1.  Ex: check the header web template.

    2.  Go to "web templates/header". Open the header source html file: "Header.webtemplate.source.html"

3.  Run the bootstrap diff extension to compare the changes.

    1.  In VS code, execute "Ctrl + Shift + P" to open the command palette.

    2.  In the command palette, execute the command "Bootstrap Diff".

    3.  On execution version 3 file opens on the right alongside the version 5 file in a different window, with the changes being highlighted.

    4.  version 5 file on the left will also show the breaking change as a tooltip when you hover over the highlighted change.

### **Step 5: Uploading the migrated website record**

1.  Use the PAC CLI upload command to upload the migrated website record to the org

    1.  Command : pac paportal upload -p "MigratedWebsiteFolderPath"

### **Step 6: Comparing the two websites.**

1.  After uploading, the migrated site will be a Bootstrap version 5 compliant website.

2.  Compare the diffs using the diff extension and compare the rendering of Site 1 (on Bootstrap version 3) and Site 2 (on Bootstrap version 5).

3.  Based on the above comparisons, you can make changes to the code of Bootstrap version 5 site as needed based on the changes introduced with Bootstrap version 5.

## FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)

### I see some UX changes on the new sites created with Bootstrap version 5. Is this expected?

While we have tried to preserve the look and feel of the Bootstrap version 5 templates in comparison to Bootstrap version 3, there are certain changes which have been introduced with Bootstrap version 5 which render a slightly different UX.
