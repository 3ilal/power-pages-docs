# Create site structure

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

When you've created a few pages, the page hierarchy is displayed in a nested structure on the **Main navigation** menu.

To change page hierarchy:

1. Select the ellipsis (**...**) on the page you want to move.

    | Action | Description |

    | Move to other pages| Moves the page into the **Other pages** section. |
    | Move to main navigation | Shows the page in the header of the home page. |
    | Move up | Moves the page up in the hierarchy. |
    | Move down | Moves the page down in the hierarchy. |
