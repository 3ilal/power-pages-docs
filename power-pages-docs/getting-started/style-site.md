# Style your pages site

In Power Pages you will find a robust set of themes and tools to use to style your site. There are several preset themes that may be applied to your portal.  You can use these themes as a starting point and apply further customization with the styling menu.

1. Sign in to [Power Apps](https://make.powerapps.com/).

1. Select the **Styling** tab from the left navigation pane.

    - Note the list of choices in the Themes Workspace. Further customization can be done with the Styling Menu.

1. Select one of the preset themes to see how the style is reflected on the canvas workspace to the right.

    - Each theme has its own palette.

    - You can adjust the styling menu to make adjustments to each theme. Text options include font, weight, size, and color.

1. Choose between **Save Changes** or **Discard Changes** after you've made your edits.

    - A modified theme will be noted next to the theme name unless or until a theme is reset to preserve changes.

## Resetting a Theme

To **reset a theme** to it's original state, choose the ellipses to open the **Reset to default option**.

You can also use the viewport selector to choose from web, tablet, and mobile views of the workspace.  

To see the site in the 1.0 Version of Power Pages, slide the new design studio toggle to the off position.

## Theme Mapping

Each color on the palatte maps to a specific element on the page.  The preset theme consists of nine colors and three slots for user-selected colors.  If you customize elements, the mapping will not be correct unless the theme is reset.  

To add a new color or to change an existing color, select the + option below and choose your color using the color picker, Hex value, or RGB values.

Once a new color is added to the color palatte it can be used to color components in the context menu.
