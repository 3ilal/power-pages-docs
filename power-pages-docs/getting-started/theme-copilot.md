# Create AI-generated theme using Copilot (preview)

[!INCLUDE [cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

Copilot for theme allows you to create a theme for your brand from the design studio. After generating the theme using Copilot, you can customize the theme further in the [Styling workspace](style-site.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> - This is a preview feature.
> - [!INCLUDE [preview-tags](../includes/cc-preview-features-definition.md)]
> - This feature doesn't support non-English language input.
> - This feature will be available for preview in the United States only.
> - To understand capabilities and limitations of AI-powered and Copilot features in Power Pages, see [Transparency notes for Power Pages](../transparency-note.md).

To use Copilot for theme:

1. Go to the [Pages workspace](first-page.md).

1. Select the **Copilot** icon.

1. Describe the theme that you want to generate using AI. For example, "Create a theme for Microsoft."

    :::image type="content" source="media/theme-copilot/sidecar.png" alt-text="The Copilot sidecar in design studio with a user's description and responses displayed.":::

To customize the theme, you can choose the following options:

- **Try again** - generates new theme based on the already provided description.

- **Styling Workspace** – The AI theme can be customized in [styling workspace](style-site.md) manually just like any other theme. 

To avoid unintentionally publishing changes to your site, review, edit, and verify the generated theme to make sure it fits your requirements before changing the [site visibility](../security/site-visibility.md) to **Public**.
