1. Describe the theme that you want to generate using AI. For example, "Create a theme for Microsoft."

    :::image type="content" source="media/theme-copilot/create-theme.png" alt-text="A screenshot of Copilot in design studio with an AI-generated theme displayed.":::

To customize the theme, you can choose the following options:

- **Try again**: Generates new theme based on the already provided description.

- **Styling workspace**: The AI theme can be customized in the [styling workspace](style-site.md) manually just like any other theme. 

To avoid unintentionally publishing changes to your site, review, edit, and verify the generated theme to make sure it fits your requirements.
