# Power Pages trial FAQ

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The Power Pages trial offers a simple and easy experience for sign-up, sign-in, and usage. However, if you're stuck or have questions about the trial, check out this page for answers. 

To sign up for the trial, go to the [Power Pages overview page](https://powerpages.microsoft.com/), and select **Start free**.

### Can I convert the trial to a paid license?

Yes, you can purchase licenses through direct, credit card purchase at https://admin.microsoft.com. Or, you can work with the Microsoft sales team to establish a volume licensing or enterprise agreement. Visit our [pricing page](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/pricing/) for more information on pricing and purchasing. 

To purchase the license using an existing account, work with the administrator of the account to apply for licenses. 

After you've applied for the license to your tenant, you can publish your environment to production. You can remove the sample data installed in your trial environment. However, you have to manually reset the configuration and remove any test data that you've added. We recommend that you create a fresh environment to use for your production environment and add the configurations you'd like to move forward with. 

### What are the trial limits and quotas?

The following limitations apply for the trial:
- The trial environment is available to you for 30 days. After that, you can request an extension for another 30 days.
- A Power Pages site is always created as a trial. A trial site, which expires after 30 days, is useful for trying out its capabilities at no cost. After it expires, the site is suspended and shut down. Seven days after it's suspended, the trial site is deleted. The trial site can be converted into a production site from the Power Pages admin center if you have the required licenses. More information: [Convert a site from trial to production](/power-apps/maker/portals/admin/convert-portal#convert-a-portal-from-trial-to-production)
- If your trial site is created in a trial environment, your trial site will only be available until your trial environment is available. If your environment expires before the trial site expires, you will lose access to your trial site. 

## Power Pagesâ€“specific questions

### What email address can I use?

This message is shown when an administrator of a tenant has blocked users from being able to start a new trial with their organization account.

You can set up a new work or school account by signing up for a new Microsoft 365 E3 or Dynamics 365 Sales or Customer Service Trial with your personal email.

### How do I start using the trial?

After you sign up for the trial, you'll arrive on the app's main screen. The main screen provides links to user guides and tutorials. To learn more, visit the links in the [Additional resources](trial-signup.md#additional-resources) section on the trial setup page.

### What features are available in the trial?

Your trial includes a trial environment. You can create secure, scalable business websites using low-code and pro developer experiences inside the trial environment. 

### Can I create a trial site inside my existing environments?

If you already have necessary privileges to create or edit a site in an environment, you can create a trial site inside of the existing environments too. 

### How long does the trial last?

The Power Pages trial lasts 30 days. You can [convert the trial site](/power-apps/maker/portals/admin/convert-portal#convert-a-portal-from-trial-to-production) into a production site.  

### Will I have to use this experience every time I come to Power Pages? 

The sign-up experience is a one-time experience to get you started with Power Pages. After you create a site successfully the first time, in your next visit you'll be redirected to the Power Pages home page. You can continue to create a new trial site as needed from the home page by using **Create a Site**. 

### Can I edit an existing site by using the new Power Pages experience?

During the first run of the sign-up experience, you need to create a trial site. After you've successfully created the site, you can access an existing trial site (provided you have the necessary permissions). 

### How long will it take for the trial site to get created? 

When you create a trial site in a new trial environment, it takes a few minutes, because the new trial environment created is optimized and preinstalled with the site templates in it. When you create a trial site in an existing environment that doesn't have the preinstalled site templates, site creation will take around 15 to 30 minutes because the site template has to be installed before the site itself is created.
