# Tutorial: Add custom CSS to your site

The [style workspace](tutorial-style-site.md) allows you to edit some of the theme features of your site, such as fonts and colors; however, you may wish to apply your own custom CSS themes.

You can create your own theme by defining a custom CSS file and uploading it to your site.  

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Upload a custom CSS file

## Prerequisites

- A Power Pages subscription or trial. [Get a Power Pages trial here](trial-signup.md).
- A Power Pages site created. [Create a Power Pages site](create-manage.md).
- A custom theme created using your favorite CSS editor.

> [!NOTE]  
> Any custom theme you create must be compatible with Bootstrap v3.

## Add custom CSS to your site

1. Create or download a custom theme and save as a .CSS file.

1. Go to [Power Pages](https://make.powerpages.microsoft.com/).
