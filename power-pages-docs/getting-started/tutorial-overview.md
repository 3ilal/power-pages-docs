<!-- General notes about the tutorials:
- Walk through each step of the tutorials as if you were a brand-new user. Does every step make sense? Is everything the user needs to know included in the instructions?
- The screenshots aren't really very useful. There's a lot of empty space shown. Some are included just to highlight things that are pretty obvious without them, like commands and icons.
- Since each tutorial builds on the previous ones by design, maybe don't have prereqs that imply each tutorial stands alone. I don't think you need to remind people to get a Power Pages license and create a site before starting every tutorial. I think it *would* be helpful to refer to previous tutorials.
