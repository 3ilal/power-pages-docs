# Use design studio

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

The Power Page design studio is an intuitive click and drag interface that enables low-code makers to build and configure rich business web apps. It has four marquee experiences called workspaces that focus on specific user jobs:

- **Pages workspace** enables you to design and build webpages with in-context editing and add content with no- and low-code widgets such as text, image, video, PowerBI reports, lists, forms and others. Learn more about Pages workspace.

- **Styling workspace** lets you apply global site styles. You can apply corporate branding updates and review the changes in the preview on the right. Styling offers 13 preset themes. For each theme, you can customize the color palette, background color, font styles, button styles, and section margins. [Learn more about Styling workspace](style-site.md).

- **Data workspace** lets you easily model, visualize and manage business data for the site with tables, forms, and lists. You can create and edit Dataverse tables for the site and create new or edit existing model-drive forms and views. Changes made in the Data workspace are stored in the Common data store. [Learn more about Data workspace](use-data-workspace.md).

- **Set up workspace** enables site administrators to configure site settings such as identity providers, security and permissions, go-live configurations, and progressive web app (PWA) settings. [Learn more about Set up workspace](..\configure\setup-workspace.md).

## Preview your site

When you are done building, preview your site with the "Preview" option. You can preview on desktop or mobile. Selecting **Desktop** opens the site in a new web browser tab. Scanning the QR code with your mobile device opens the site on the mobile web browser.
