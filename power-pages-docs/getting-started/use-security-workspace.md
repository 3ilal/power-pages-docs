# Overview of the Security workspace

## Monitor

### Run scan (preview)

Run a security scan to enhance your site's resilience by identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, safeguarding it against potential threats and ensuring a secure online environment for users.

Select the **Run Deep Scan** button to run the security scan.  

> [!NOTE]
> - By default, security scan only scans anonymous pages.  To include authenticated pages in the scan, select the check box next to **Include authenticated pages in scan**.
> - Report summaries for security scan are only supported in English-US language.

The scan takes between 2 to 4 hours to complete. Once the scan is completed, you will receive an email. After you receive the email confirmation, you can view the scan report summary by returning to the **Run scan** section of the Security workspace.

The summary report includes a list of failed checks and corresponding alerts, as well as a description of how to fix the alerts. You can optionally download the report as a PDF.

You can cancel the security scan at any time by //WHAT DO I DO HERE???
