# Assign licensing

A free trial is available for Power Pages, which can be used to try out the new features and functionality. More information: [Power Pages trial](../getting-started/trial-signup.md)

As you work on projects and need to establish permanent sites that don't expire, Power Apps portals licenses can be used and Power Pages sites can be converted from trial to production. For detailed information, go to [Convert a portal](/power-apps/maker/portals/admin/convert-portal) in the Power Apps portals documentation. 

For detailed information on licensing, go to [Licensing](/power-platform/admin/powerapps-flow-licensing-faq#portals) in the Power Platform admin documentation.
