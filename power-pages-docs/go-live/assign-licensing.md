# Assign licensing

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

[!INCLUDE[powerapps-info](../includes/cc-powerapps-info.md)]

Power Pages are available in public preview and offers a free trial experience. However, in case you need to use a permanent website, existing Power Apps portals licensing can be used with Power Pages sites as well to get a production portal.

For detailed information on licensing, go to [Manage existing portals | Licensing](/powerapps/maker/portals/manage-existing-portals#licensing) in the Power Apps documentation.
