### YamlMime:Hub

title: Microsoft Power Pages (preview) documentation
summary: Use Power Pages to create external-facing websites that allow users outside your organization to sign in with a wide variety of identities, create and view data in Dataverse, or browse content anonymously.
# brand: aspnet | azure | dotnet | dynamics | m365 | ms-graph | office | power-apps | power-automate | power-bi | power-platform | power-virtual-agents | sql | sql-server | vs | visual-studio | windows | xamarin
brand: power-pages
# EDITOR COMMENT: If you agree with the suggested titles I provide below, please make the same title changes in the individual files. Also, you might consider using the following as a really clear, user-centered example of a hub page to model the Power Pages one on: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/ :) I think including "Sign up for free" on the hub page (like the Power Automate hub does) is a great idea.
