Power Pages can be used to create external-facing sites that allow organizations to engage with users. Makers can configure sites to enable anonymous browsing or enable users to sign in to securely create and view data.

Power Pages is built on the foundation of [Power Apps portals](/power-apps/maker/portals/) and is the newest pillar of the Power Platform. Power Pages allows you to extend existing Power Platform solutions to the web that are built on [Microsoft Dataverse](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro).
