# What is Power Pages?

Microsoft Power Pages is a secure, enterprise-grade, low-code software as a service (SaaS) platform for creating, hosting, and administering modern external-facing business websites. Whether you're a low-code maker or a professional developer, Power Pages enables you to rapidly design, configure, and publish websites that seamlessly work across web browsers and devices.

Power Pages provides you with rich, customizable templates, a fluid visual experience through a reimagined design studio, and a new, integrated learning hub to quickly build sites that suit your unique business needs.

Power Pages is the newest member of the Microsoft Power Platform family. With Power Pages, you can build sites by using the same shared business data stored in [Microsoft Dataverse](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro) that you use for building apps, workflows, intelligent virtual agents, reports, and analytics with other Microsoft Power Platform components in your organization.

## Power Apps portals and Dynamics 365 portals

Power Apps portals and Dynamics 365 portals are now referred to as Power Pages. There is no migration or upgrade process. You can use the new [Power Pages design studio](getting-started/use-design-studio.md) to edit sites created in Power Apps. Existing tools such as the [Portals Management app](configure/portal-management-app.md) and [Power Platform CLI](configure/cli-tutorial.md) will continue to work with Power Pages.</br>

We are currently migrating and merging the Power Apps portals documentation with Power Pages documentation. You may continue to see some Power Pages features referred to as Power Apps portals during this transition.
