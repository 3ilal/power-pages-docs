Power Pages provides you with rich, customizable templates and a fluid visual experience through a re-imagined design studio to quickly build business sites that suit your unique business needs. You can configure sites to enable anonymous browsing or enable users to sign in to securely create and view data.

Power Pages is the newest member of the Microsoft Power Platform family. Using Power Pages, you can build sites using the same shared business data securely stored in [Microsoft Dataverse](/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro) that you use for reporting and analytics, and for building apps, workflows, and intelligent virtual agents using other components of Power Platform.
