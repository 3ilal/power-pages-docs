# Known issues

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## Pages workspace

- Buttons added in portals built with CDS starter template can't be resized.

- You can't add deleted header logo/text in the new maker studio.  If you needed to delete these items, you'll need to do so in Portal 1.0.  Use the toggle in the command bar to return to Portal 1.0 and use code editor to add text/logo.

- Code editor doesn't support editing of header or footer code.

## Styling workspace

- Doesn't support Google Fonts due to privacy concerns.

- Section padding/margin settings feature in styling workspace won't work for portals built on CDS starter templates.

## Power Pages trial

- If your administrator disabled the self -service sign-up, you wouldn’t be able to sign up for a trial of Power Pages. 

- If your administrator disables the creation of Portal creation for non-administrator type users in your company, then you wouldn't be able to create a Portal. You would be redirected to Power Pages home page inside default environment. You would have to reach out to your administrator to provide you with an environment that has enough privileges for you to edit an existing site in the environment. 

- If your administrator disables the creation of a trial environment for non-administrator type users in your company, then you wouldn’t be able to create an environment. However, you can still create a Portal inside an existing environment in the tenant, where you have necessary minimum privileges. 

- When you create a site for a first in a new environment, you wouldn't be able to rename the environment name, however, the ability to rename the environment to be created will be available in a future update.
