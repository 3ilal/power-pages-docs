# Known issues

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

## Pages workspace

- Buttons added in portals built with the starter template can't be resized.

- You can't add a deleted header logo or text in the new design studio.  If you need to delete these items, you'll need to do so in Portal 1.0.  Use the toggle in the command bar to return to Portal 1.0 and use the code editor to add the text or logo.

- The code editor doesn't support editing header or footer code.

## Styling workspace

- Doesn't support Google Fonts due to privacy concerns.

- The section padding/margin settings feature in the Styling workspace won't work for portals built on starter templates.

## Power Pages trial

- If your administrator disabled the self-service sign-up, you won't be able to sign up for a trial of Power Pages. 

- If your administrator disables portal creation for non-administrator–type users in your company, you won't be able to create a portal. You'll be redirected to the Power Pages home page in the default environment. You'll have to reach out to your administrator to provide you with an environment that has enough privileges for you to edit an existing site in the environment. 

- If your administrator disables the creation of a trial environment for non-administrator–type users in your company, you won't be able to create an environment. However, you can still create a portal inside an existing environment in the tenant, where you have necessary minimum privileges. 

- When you create a site for the first time in a new environment, you won't be able to rename the environment; however, the ability to rename the environment when it's created will be available in a future update. 

-  If you don't see your site created when you sign up for a Power Pages trial, the site creation may have failed due to your company's tenant being in a different region than your chosen environment. You can attempt to create another site by selecting the **Create a Site** button on the Power Pages home page.
