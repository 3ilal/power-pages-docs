# Run security scan (preview)

From the Security workspace in design studio.

1. Select the **Run Deep Scan** button to run the security scan.  

    > [!NOTE]
    > By default, security scan only scans anonymous pages.  To include authenticated pages in the scan, select the check box next to **Include authenticated pages in scan**.
    >

    A notification appears in the workspace.  

1. Select the **Continue** button to begin the scan.

    You can cancel the scan at any time by returning to the workspace and selecting the **Cancel scan** button.

Once the scan is completed, you will receive an email. After you receive the email confirmation, you can view the scan report summary by returning to the **Run scan** section of the Security workspace.

## Summary report 

The summary report includes a list of failed checks and corresponding alerts, as well as a description of how to fix the alerts. You can optionally download the report as a PDF. Report summaries for security scan are only supported in English-US language.
