      - question: |
          My site has been experiencing abnormal traffic for the past day. How can I analyze this traffic pattern and safeguard my site from potential attackers?
        answer: |
          If you've activated the WAF for your site, all requests are logged and available for analysis. Download the WAF logs to examine the traffic patterns; these logs contain client IPs, socket IPs, and request URIs. You can then create custom rules using the IP address Match type to block identified IPs or ranges, or utilize Rate limit rules with specific URL parts to enforce regular threshold limits over one-minute intervals.
