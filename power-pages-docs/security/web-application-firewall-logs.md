# Web Application Firewall logs

When you activate the web application firewall in Power Pages, each request's logs are captured and stored in your Dataverse instance. To access these logs, follow these steps: 

Navigate to the Security workspace. 

Click on the 'Download firewall logs' button. 

Specify the start and end dates. 

By specifying the start and end dates, you can download only the relevant logs. By default, logs for the past 30 days are retained in Dataverse. You can modify this retention period by adjusting the settings in the configuration menu, located next to the 'Download firewall logs' button. You can extend the retention period up to 90 days, or choose to disable the capturing of firewall logs entirely.
