# Dynamics 365 templates

If you select an environment that contains Dynamics 365 applications (Dynamics 365 Sales, Dynamics 365 Customer Service, Dynamics 365 Field Service, Dynamics 365 Marketing, Dynamics 365 Project Operations or Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management), the Dynamics 365 templates would be available for you to create your Power Pages site leveraging the below templates:

- **Customer self-service**: A customer self-service site enables customers to access self-service knowledge, support resources, view the progress of their cases, and provide feedback.
- **Partner**: A partner site allows every organization with resellers, distributors, suppliers, or partners to have real-time access to every stage of shared activities.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Field Service and Project Operations packages must be installed in your Dynamics 365 organization to enable respective options. For more information, see [Integrate Project Service Automation](/dynamics365/portals/integrate-project-service-automation) and [Integrate Field Service](/dynamics365/portals/integrate-field-service).

- **Employee self-service portal**: An employee self-service portal creates an efficient and well-informed workforce by streamlining common tasks and empowering every employee with a definitive source of knowledge.
- **Community portal**: A community portal leverages peer-to-peer interactions between customers and experts to organically grow the catalog of available knowledge from knowledge base articles, forums, and blogs as well as providing feedback through comments and ratings.
