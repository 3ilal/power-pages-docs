# After School template

The After School Program template is designed to show you the capabilities of a registration portal application.  We have chosen the example of registering for after school classes; however, this template may be useful for any industry or organization wishing to create a registration portal.

There are two key users that the template is designed for:

- The parent who is trying to register their children for after school classes.

- The school representative is looking to maintain a list of courses, edit existing courses, and add new courses to the catalog.

As a parent who is looking to register for classes, you can do the following seamlessly:

- Register for an after-school class from the list of available classes.

- Modify the schedule.

- Add and edit attendee information.

- Receive emails with information about the class which you can use to modify your registration.

As a representative of the school, you can do the following seamlessly:

- Maintain the course catalog.

- Add and modify existing classes.
