# Book a Meeting template

Book a meeting is designed to show you the capabilities of a scheduling template. We've chosen the example of scheduling with a bank representative.  The scheduling principle will apply to any industry or organization looking to stand up a scheduling portal.

## Users

There are two key users that the template is designed for:

- The banking customer is trying to book an appointment with the bank representative.

- The bank representative who is looking at the list of appointments and managing their calendars and appointments.

### Bank customers

As a customer of a bank, you can do the following seamlessly:

- Book an appointment with a specific bank representative at a specific bank branch and select your preferred time.

- Cancel and reschedule your appointments via links provided in the email booking confirmation.

### Bank representatives

As a bank representative, you can do the following seamlessly:

- Manage your schedule.
- Create, update, and manage appointments.
- Block your schedule to indicate time away and other commitments.
- Receive email notifications for appointment changes.
