# Book a Meeting template

Book a meeting is designed to show you the capabilities of a scheduling template. We've picked the example of scheduling with a bank representative; however, the scheduling principle will apply to any industry or organization looking to stand up a scheduling portal.

There are two key users that the template is designed for:

- The customer of the bank is trying to book an appointment with the bank representative.

- The bank representative who is looking at the list of appointments and managing their calendars and appointments.

As a customer of a bank, you can do the following seamlessly:

- Book an appointment with a certain bank representative, in a certain bank branch and the time that best suits the customer.

- The customer can also cancel and reschedule the appointments via links present in the email that they receive upon booking confirmation.
