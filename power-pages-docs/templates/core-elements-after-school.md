The **After School Program Registration** has a rich set of out of the box pages that are defined based on the user scenarios and user roles.

The web pages are designed to target two core user personas

- The parent who is trying to register for the course.

- The representative of the school managing the courses.

In the screenshot below you will see there are 2 sections for page navigation:

- Main navigation: this section covers the pages you have as part of your main navigation experiences.

- Other pages: this section houses the subpages that you land on from one of the pages in the main navigation.
