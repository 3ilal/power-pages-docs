# Core elements of the After School Program template

After School Program Registration has many core elements and components, which come together to solve the problem end to end. This template includes basic forms, lists, and code components.

## Pages in the After School template

The **After School Program Registration** has a rich set of out of the box pages that are defined based on the user scenarios and user roles.

The web pages are designed to target two core user personas

- The parent who is trying to register for the course.

- The representative of the school managing the courses.

### Sections in the After School template pages

There are two sections for page navigation:

- Main navigation: this section covers the pages you have as part of your main navigation experiences.

- Other pages: this section houses the subpages that you land on from one of the pages in the main navigation.

The following tables are available for you to customize:

Parent registering for a course

INSERT TABLE FOR PARENT 

School representative

INSERT TABLE FOR SCHOOL REP
