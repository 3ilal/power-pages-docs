The email notifications will have hyperlinks embedded to allow recipients to navigate back to the portal.

To ensure the email notifications have the correct domain embedded, add the website ID to the flows that have been configured as part of the solution.

Grab the website ID from the URL â€“ in this case **c7be234f-d856-ec11-8f8e-002248233fb1** is the website ID that we have.
