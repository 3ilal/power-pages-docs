# Data workspace for Book a Meeting

The solution template comes with a rich set of sample data that you can edit from within the maker studio.  
With the Data workspace you can look at the tables that are part of the solution and edit the records, add new records.

Booking an appointment uses all the pages you see here and also the "Location" that's housed under the other tables.

Bank representative specialties use the contact and service tables.

Bank representative's homepage uses the appointment, appointment request and also the contact tables.
