# Edit the custom components for Book a Meeting

Book a Meeting has many custom components and custom code, and you can make changes to those. You can use the robust PAC CLI tooling we've enabled for portals with VSCode.

For more information visit [MS Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/power-apps-cli).

This template has the folder structure as pasted below and you can edit the code that comes as part of the solution template or extend the capabilities of the template according to your needs.

The styling and css can be found under web-files, the various pages and their html can be found under web-pages and the components that are integrated as part of the pages can be found under the right components.
