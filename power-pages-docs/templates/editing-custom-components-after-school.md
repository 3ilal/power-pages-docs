# Editing the Custom Components for After School Program

After School Program has many custom components and custom code, and you can edit these directly using the robust PAC CLI tooling we have enabled for Portals in connection with VS Code.

For more information visit [MS Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/portals/power-apps-cli).

This template has the folder structure as pasted below and you can edit the code that comes as part of the solution template or extend the capabilities of the template according to your needs.

The styling and CSS can be found under web-files. The various pages and their HTML can be found under web-pages. The components that are integrated as part of the pages can be found under the right components.

The bulk of the code for this template is under basic-forms, lists and web-pages.
