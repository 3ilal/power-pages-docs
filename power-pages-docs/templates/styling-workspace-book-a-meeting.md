# Styling workspace for Book a Meeting

Book a meeting comes with a custom theme that's mapped to one of the themes out of the box. You can always change the themes to the available ones and select the ones that best appeal to you. We recommend that you stay with the theme that came out of the box to enable the best styling and UX for the end users.
