## Create a page with a list

Power Pages offers a seamless ability to interact with Dataverse with the new [data workspace](../getting-started/use-data-workspace.md).

The following series of videos will demonstrate how to create a page displaying records from Dataverse in three easy steps:

| Step | Task | Step-by-step video |  
| - | - | - | 
| 1 | Create a table in Dataverse | [video](#create-a-table) <br> [tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-add-list-to-page.md) |
| 2 | Create a view | [video](#create-a-view) <br> [tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-add-list-to-page.md) |
| 3 | Add a list to the page | [video](#add-a-list-to-page) <br> [tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-add-list-to-page.md) |

### Create a table

## Configure table permissions

Business information in Dataverse cannot be viewed on Power Pages automatically.

To allow access to Dataverse records in Power Pages sites, you will need to configure table permissions and associate the table permissions to web roles.

The following three videos will explain the concepts of table permissions, setting up access, and assigning web roles.

| Step | Task | Overview video |  
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Create table permissions | [video](#create-table-permissions) [tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-display-data-securely.md) |
| 2 | Set up access type and privileges | [video](#create-table-permissions)  [tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-display-data-securely.md) |
| 3 | Add web roles | [video](#add-web-roles) [tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-display-data-securely.md) |

## Create a page with a simple form

Forms on pages are created from Dataverse table forms.

The following videos will show you to create and add a form to your page, capture rich information through code components and configure form actions when the information in the form is submitted.

| Step | Task | Step-by-step video |

## Configure access to your site

Power Pages has a robust security model to ensure that business information is properly protected.

Users can be provided access to your site through authentication. Power Pages users are represented by Microsoft Dataverse contact records. Power Pages can be integrated with a number of authentication providers such as Azure AD B2C, Microsoft, LinkedIn and others.

The following videos will show you provide an overview of authentication and walk you through configuring an identity provider and configuring page permissions.

| Step | Task | Step-by-step video |
