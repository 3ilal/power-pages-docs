## Create a page with a list

Power Pages offers a seamless ability to interact with business data stored in Dataverse with the new [Data workspace](../getting-started/use-data-workspace.md).

## Configure table permissions

Business information in Dataverse can't automatically be viewed in Power Pages. To allow access to Dataverse records in Power Pages sites, you'll need to configure table permissions and associate the table permissions to web roles.

The following three videos will explain the concepts of table permissions, setting up access, and assigning web roles.

| Step | Task | Video and tutorial |  
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Create table permissions | [video](#create-table-permissions)<br/> [tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-display-data-securely.md) |
| 2 | Set up access type and privileges | [video](#create-table-permissions)<br/>  [tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-display-data-securely.md) |
| 3 | Add web roles | [video](#add-web-roles)<br/> [tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-display-data-securely.md) |

## Create a page with a simple form

Forms on pages are created from Dataverse table forms. The following videos show you how to create and add a form to your page, capture rich information through code components, and configure form actions when the information in the form is submitted.

| Step | Task | Video and tutorial |  
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Create a table in Dataverse | [video](#create-a-table)<br/>[tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-add-list-to-page.md) |

## Configure access to your site

Power Pages has a robust security model to ensure that business information is properly protected. 

Users can be provided access to your site through authentication. Power Pages users are represented by Dataverse contact records. Power Pages can be integrated with a number of authentication providers such as Azure Active Directory B2C, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and others.

The following videos provide an overview of authentication and walk you through configuring an identity provider and configuring page permissions.
