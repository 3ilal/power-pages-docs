## Create a page with a list

Power Pages offers a seamless ability to interact with business data stored in Dataverse with the new [Data workspace](../getting-started/use-data-workspace.md).

The following series of videos demonstrate how to create a page displaying business information in three easy steps.

| Step | Task | Video and tutorial |  
| - | - | - | 
| 1 | Create a table in Data workspace | [video](#create-a-table)<br/>[tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-add-list-to-page.md) |
| 2 | Create a view | [video](#create-a-view)<br/>[tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-add-list-to-page.md#create-a-view) |
| 3 | Add a list to the page | [video](#add-a-list-to-page)<br/> [tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-add-list-to-page.md#add-a-list-to-the-page) |

## Configure table permissions

Business information in Dataverse can't automatically be viewed in Power Pages. To allow access to Dataverse records in Power Pages sites, you'll need to configure table permissions and associate the table permissions to web roles.

The following three videos will explain the concepts of table permissions, setting up access, and assigning web roles.

| Step | Task | Video and tutorial |  
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Create table permissions | [video](#create-table-permissions)<br/> [tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-display-data-securely.md) |
| 2 | Set up access type and privileges | [video](#create-table-permissions)<br/>  [tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-display-data-securely.md#set-access-type-and-privileges) |
| 3 | Add web roles | [video](#add-web-roles)<br/> [tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-display-data-securely.md#add-web-roles) |

## Create a page with a simple form

Forms on pages are created from Dataverse table forms. The following videos show you how to create and add a form to your page, capture rich information through code components, and configure form actions when the information in the form is submitted.

## Configure access to your site

Power Pages has a robust security model to ensure that business information is properly protected. 

Users can be provided access to your site through authentication. Power Pages users are represented by Dataverse contact records. Power Pages can be integrated with many authentication providers such as Azure Active Directory B2C, Microsoft, LinkedIn, and others.

The following videos provide an overview of authentication and walk you through configuring an identity provider and configuring page permissions.

| Step | Task | Video and tutorial |  
| - | - | - |
| 1 | Authentication overview | [video](#authentication-overview)<br/>[tutorial](../getting-started/tutorial-setup-site-authentication.md) |

## Add custom styling

The [Styling workspace](#setup-your-brand-kit) allows you to edit some of the theme features of your site, such as fonts and colors; however, you may wish to apply your own custom CSS themes.

You can create your own theme by defining a custom CSS file and uploading it to your site.
